# OASIS PHP integration

Library for integrating PHP applications with Oasis.

## Get started

All start with the configuration of the Oasis instance.
The configuration needs 3 elements:

* the OpenID Provider Configuration Document of the OASIS server,
* the client identifier
* the client password.

For the moment, the only available mean to provide the OpenID Provider Configuration Document to the API is to use a PHP array representing it.

For more information about the OpenID Provider Configuration Document:
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig

```php
$oasis = Oasis::builder()
  ->setProviderConfig(array(
    'authorization_endpoint' =>
      'https://oasis.example.org/a/auth',
    'token_endpoint' =>
      'https://oasis.example.com/a/token'
  ))
  ->setCredentials('myClientId', 'myClientPassword')
  // Optional: use only if you have a single 'redirect_uri'
  ->setDefaultRedirectUri('https://app.example.com/redirect/')
  ->build();
```

## OAuth 2 + OpenID Connect API

### Get the Authorization request URI

The first step to authenticate someone and get authorizations is to create the Authorization request URI.

```php
list($authorizationRequestUri, $serializedState, $nonce) = $oasis
  ->initAuthorizationRequest()
  // Optional if you only want the 'openid' scope (the default value).
  ->setScope(array('openid', 'profile'))
  // Optional if default 'redirect_uri'
  // Will override the default one if provided
  ->setRedirectUri('https://app2.example.com/another-redirect')
  // Optional: Can be used in the second step to, e.g., redirect
  // your client to the right service / page
  // This API will add a secure random automatically
  // (even if you don't provide this parameter)
  ->setState('project.1.edit')
  ->buildUri();
```
There are other available parameters. For more information about them: [AuthorizationRequestBuilder.php source file](https://github.com/pole-numerique/oasis-php-integration/blob/master/src/PoleNumerique/Oasis/Authz/AuthorizationRequestBuilder.php)

The `$serializedState` and `$nonce` returned by the function need to be saved into a _session_ linked to the current user, as they are required for the next step.

Now you can redirect the user to this URI.

http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest

### Get the access token

After the user logged in and authorized your application (or not), he will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` provided in the Authorization request.

The result is conveyed in the query parameters.

Provide the query string of the actual uri to the API for processing it and get an access token in exchange (if the Authorization process was successful).

```php
try {
  list($accessToken, $refreshToken, $idToken, $state) = $oasis
    ->initExchangeCodeForTokenRequest()
    // The query string of the actual uri used by
    // the Authorization endpoint to redirect the user.
    // An array corresponding to the query string can also
    // be provided instead of the query string.
    ->setAuthorizationResponse($queryString)
    // Required if used in Authorization request
    ->setRedirectUri('https://app2.example.com/another-redirect')
    ->setExpectedState($serializedState)
    ->setExpectedNonce($nonce)
    // Optional, in seconds
    // Indicates the maximum lifetime of the HTTP request
    ->setTimeout(30)
    ->execute();
} catch (AuthorizationResponseException $e) {
  // The authorization request was not successful.
  // Check the associated error code to know what happened
  echo $e->getError() . ' => ' . $e->getErrorDescription();
} catch (TokenResponseException $e) {
  // The access token request was not successful.
  // Check the associated error code to know what happened
  echo $e->getError() . ' [' . $e->getStatusCode() . '] => '
    . $e->getErrorDescription();
}
// Congratulations! You have your access token!
echo $accessToken->getCode();
// If you want to have the expiration time of your access token
echo $accessToken->getExpiresAt(); // timestamp
// The user may authorize more than the requested scope
// To get the authorized scope:
echo $accessToken->getScope();
```

You may store the received ID Token to use it in Authorization requests with the `id_token_hint` parameter.

The received state is the one you provided in the previous Authorization request.
